# mandelbrot
My first project written in C.  This code generates the classic mandelbrot set utilizing the stb_image_write library 
written by Sean Barret.  Interact with this program on the command line by specifying arguments in the following order..

1. maxIterations: how many iterations before a point is considered to be "in the set."
2. xRange: range of x values that the window will span (how zoomed in the set will appear).
3. centerX: specify the x-coordinate that will correspond to the center of the window.
4. centerI: specify the coordinate on the imaginary plane that will correspond to the center of the window.
